There needs to be a generic buffer library to allocate vertexes and indexes.
This should also probably handle updating the data and sending to the engine.
	So basically when an object is created, it allocates some space in the
	vertex and index buffers, and uses references to them



Then we need to add some code to handle multiple uniforms 


Simple Tasks:
	- Makefile
		- add a fixme target
		- dependancy generation
	- Clean some fixes.
	- vertex.h -> trtl_model?
	- Add some tests for trtl_object_draw
