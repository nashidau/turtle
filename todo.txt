Add some monsters from quest.

Get rid of the constants:
	- maybe save the code in wiki so O can see it in the future

Sprite2:
	- Rename to sprite soonish
	- Add support for multiple objects
	- add zoom support
	- fix height/width of sprites

Add a proper event rendering loop
	messages from threads

Add animated zoom to quest

Finish moving VkPipeline{Layout} out of trtl.
	- need a pipeline cache
Maybe add pushconstant support through trtl_uniform
	- so bind then push the cosntant at draw tim

Make it possible to add and remove objects at run time.

There needs to be a generic buffer library to allocate vertexes and indexes.
This should also probably handle updating the data and sending to the engine.
	So basically when an object is created, it allocates some space in the
	vertex and index buffers, and uses references to them

Focus & a keyboard model

bear used to generate the compile commands.

add running tests to the standard build target

generate xcode project file to compile on mac in a more reasoable manner

Simple Tasks:
	- create_vertex_buffers verte set api is kinda dumb for it's current use
	- Clean some fixes.
	- vertex.h -> trtl_model?
	- Add some tests for trtl_object_draw
	- Add typedef for the 'frame'.  trtl_frame_id or similar
		- make it small - uint8_t probably
	- Loading objects should use a shared index cache for 
		multiple of the same object.  Extra level of indirection on loading I guess
	- Use vkResetCommandBuffer instead of allocating each frame

Maybe simple tasks:
	- allow empty layers
	- Create a VkPipelineCache
