First up is to clear the warning.  We want a clean compile. 

Next is to make trtle object do something useful

First move the model iteself into the trtl object
	Basically at create time it should take in the params

Then we need to add some code to handle multiple uniforms 



Simple Tasks:
	- Makefile
		- Add a 'clean' target
		- Add a proper list of objects in the C file
		- add a fixme target
	- Clean some fixes.
	- vertex.h -> trtl_model?
	- Add some tests for trtl_object_draw
